# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio project, developed step by step as part of the **Intro to Software Engineering** course.

The goal of this website is to present my professional profile and the projects I've worked on, while applying the knowledge gained during the course. The site was built entirely from scratch, starting with basic HTML and CSS, and culminating in deployment via GitHub Pages.

## ðŸ”§ How the portfolio was built

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.1 â€“ Introduction to HTML and the Web  
I began by understanding how the web works and what HTML is. I created my first `index.html` file with a basic page structure.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.2 â€“ HTML Elements and File Structure  
I learned how to use key HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.) and structured my project files and folders in a clear and scalable way.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.3 â€“ HTML Best Practices  
I improved semantic structure, accessibility, and indentation. I applied `alt` attributes to images and organized the page for better readability.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.4 â€“ Introduction to CSS  
I created a `style.css` stylesheet to define colors, fonts, sizes, and spacing â€” giving the site its initial visual identity.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.5 â€“ CSS Box Model and Layout  
I practiced working with the box model and used Flexbox to organize content into a responsive layout.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.6 â€“ Responsive Design  
I added media queries to make the layout adapt to different screen sizes, especially for mobile and tablet devices.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.7 â€“ Advanced CSS  
I integrated pseudo-classes, basic animations, and CSS variables to enhance interactivity and maintainability.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.8 â€“ Version Control with Git and GitHub  
I initialized the project with Git, created branches, committed regularly, and pushed the code to GitHub. I used GitHub Desktop and the terminal to track my progress.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.9 â€“ Final Project Assembly  
I brought together all the components developed in the previous tasks. I finalized layout, content, images, navigation, and ensured a clean structure ready for deployment.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.10 â€“ Code Quality, Testing, and Web Hosting  
I installed linters:
- `HTMLHint` for HTML
- `Stylelint` for CSS

I resolved all issues and warnings. I tested the website using:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari (simulated)
- Microsoft Edge
- Mobile (via Chrome DevTools and BrowserStack)

Finally, I deployed the site using **GitHub Pages**, configuring it to publish from the root of the `main` branch.
